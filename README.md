# Control de precios

This project is a CRM practice, for merge Oxi-Mercedes S.A. sistem, with TiendaNube and Mercadolibre.
The project tries to group several tools of common use in the day to day, at the same time that it has a synchronization system between the 3 Stock and the 3 Price Lists (In the 3 platforms)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.
It is designed to be used locally as a Windows executable (as requested by the company), or if necessary, to be hosted online. 
It utilizes a custom backend and a MySQL database. The app's primary purpose is to enable tracking of prices across online platforms, as the local billing and stock system is outdated and the company does not wish to migrate. 
For the local and web systems, CSV uploads are used to update and export data. In the Mercadolibre section, the platform's development API is used to allow for price and stock management.


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
